> #### Structural Bandit

> Let's consider a structural bandit task where larger arms are more rewarding. (Assuming `NUM_ARMS` = 4, `NUM_TRIALS` = 5)

> 1. Specify the feature: `Size` is an arm-based feature , with levels of `3` (Small, Medium, Large).

> 2. Specify the allocation pattern: The allocation pattern is `Shuffle`, which means the feature is allocated randomly with roughly equal number of each level.

> \begin{bmatrix}

> 1 & 0 & 0 \\

> 0 & 1 & 0 \\

> 0 & 0 & 1 \\

> 0 & 1 & 0 \\

> \end{bmatrix}

> Rows are arm indices, and columns are possible sizes. There are 4 arms, and 3 possible sizes. The first arm is the smallest, the second and the forth arm are of medium size, the third arm is the largest.

> 3. Specify the mapping form: The reward is linearly correlated with the size level. Let's say larger size is more rewarding.

> Rows are size levels, and columns are arm indices.

> 1. Generate the reward matrix: Multiplying the feature allocation matrix and mapping matrix, we can generate the reward matrix for each arm.

> Then we know that on this feature dimension, arm 3 is the best, arm 1 is the worst, arm 2 and 4 are of medium reward.
